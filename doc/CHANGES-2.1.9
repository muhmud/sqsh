                     What is new or fixed in version sqsh-2.1.9


                       New features, enhancements, bug fixes:

1 - Feature     - New -i option to the \bcp command that will enable you to execute
                  a SQL command on the target server just before the bulk copy
                  operation starts. This is very useful to do some initialization
                  on the target server. You could for example truncate the target
                  table first, or run a stored procedure to change the target database
                  options. For example:

    $ sqsh -SPROD -Uworkshop -Pmy5ecret
    1> select * from proddb..materials
    2> \bcp -S DTA -i "truncate table testdb..materials" -N testdb..materials

    Starting copy...
    Batch successfully bulk-copied to SQL Server

    18 rows copied.
    Clock Time (sec.): Total = 0.1250  Avg = 0.0069 (144.00 rows per sec.)



2 - Feature     - Introduce the variables datefmt and timefmt that control how
                  SQL server DATE and TIME datatypes are converted and displayed in
                  the result set. This is similar to the existing datetime datatype
                  conversion routines. By default these variables are set to NULL
                  which means no conversion will be done and the CT-Lib functions
                  will decide how to display the date and time datatype columns.
                  Note, the variables can be preset in the .sqshrc file.
                  For example:

    1> \set datefmt='%d %B %Y'
    1> \set timefmt='%H:%M:%S'
    1> \set datetime='%e %b %Y %H:%M[:%S]'
    1> select convert(date,getdate());
       -----------------

    1> select convert(time,getdate());
       --------
       15:20:27

    1> select convert(smalldatetime,getdate())
       ----------------

3 - Enhancement - Client-side password encryption is enhanced to be able to
                  use RSA encryption if the OpenClient and ASE server support it.
                  In ASE 15.0.2 a new configuration parameter was introduced,
                  "net password encryption reqd" that can be set to 1 to force
                  clients to use CT-Lib password encryption of the password that
                  is send over the network from the client to the server. Plain
                  passwords are not accepted over the network in that case.
                  If the configuration parameter is set to 2, then the client must
                  even perform stronger RSA password encryption.
                  If the parameter is set to the default value of 0, then no net
                  password encryption is required and the password will be send in
                  plain text to the server if you do not request for encryption when
                  you connect to the server.
                  Sqsh will now use the highest type of encryption possible
                  when the variable $encryption is set to On or 1. You can also start
                  sqsh with the -X option. In sqsh-2.1.9 it is also possible to use
                  the -X option with the \connect or \reconnect commands.
                  The -X option was already present on the \bcp command, but is also
                  enhanced here to use RSA encryption when appropriate.

4 - Enhancement - The \bcp command is made to work with OpenClient and bulk copy
                  library version 15.7.

5 - Bugfix      - When the result set is displayed in CSV format and the data contains
                  a double quote, it is now preceded with an additional double quote.
                  That makes it possible to read the data into a spreadsheet program
                  much more easily.

6 - Bugfix      - Prototype declaration of the readline function unstifle_history
                  changed from "extern void" to "extern int" as some picky
                  compiler settings may complain about a redeclaration of this
                  function from /usr/include/readline/history.h.

7 - Bugfix      - Parsing of the SQSH environment variable for sqsh startup options
                  failed. In particular when options were used that do not require any
                  arguments. For example:

   $ export SQSH="-X -SDTA -b"
   $ sqsh -Usa -P
   sqsh: Options must begin with '-'
   Use: sqsh ....


This version of sqsh has been successfully built and tested on Cygwin 32 bits,
Solaris x86_64, Linux Ubuntu 32bits, Linux CentOS 5.2 64 bits, AIX 5.3L 64 bits.
Also various versions of Readline, Sybase OpenClient (15.7, 15.5) and freetds
(0.83, 0.91) have been used to build and test sqsh-2.1.9. Enjoy!!!




                Changed source files in sqsh-2.1.9 compared to sqsh-2.1.8


sqsh-2.1.9/src/cmd_bcp.c
    Implementation of feature 1 (-i option) and enhancement 3 (RSA password encryption)
    and enhancement 4 (bulk copy library version 15.7 awareness)

sqsh-2.1.9/src/cmd_connect.c
    Enhancement 3 (RSA password encryption) and addition of -X parameter
    to the \connect and \reconnect command.
    Also some improvements on password_retry when connecting to a Sybase
    Replication Server, Sybase IQ Server or MSSQL server are implemented.

sqsh-2.1.9/src/dsp.c
    Feature 2, datefmt and timefmt implementation.

sqsh-2.1.9/src/dsp.h
    Feature 2, datefmt and timefmt implementation.

sqsh-2.1.9/src/dsp_conv.c
    Feature 2, datefmt and timefmt implementation.

sqsh-2.1.9/src/dsp_csv.c
    Bug fix 5 implementation.

sqsh-2.1.9/src/dsp_desc.c
    Feature 2, datefmt and timefmt implementation.

sqsh-2.1.9/src/Makefile.in
    Removed references to files sqsh_ctx.c and sqsh_ctx.h. These are
    not being used and will no longer be distributed in the tar ball.

sqsh-2.1.9/src/sqsh_config.
    Version string changed to sqsh-2.1.9

sqsh-2.1.9/src/sqsh_getopt.c
    Bug fix 7 implementation.

sqsh-2.1.9/src/sqsh_global.c
    Copyright string updated.

sqsh-2.1.9/src/sqsh_main.c
    Environment variable rcfile is set to NULL when sqsh started with -r option
    without a sqshrc file specified.
    Temporary environment variable cur_rcfile removed when finished with sqshrc
    file processing.

sqsh-2.1.9/src/sqsh_readline.h
    Bugfix 6 implementation.

sqsh-2.1.9/src/var.h
    For feature 2, the variables datefmt and timefmt are defined here.
    All variables that are defined to NULL by default, must have the ability
    to be reset back to NULL with \set varname=NULL .
    For those variables that did not have a setting/validation function defined,
    this function is now set to var_set_nullstr.
    Variables that are also stored in specific storage structures (like maxlen,
    datefmt, datetime, bcp_colsep, e.a), along with the g_env environment
    setting, are set to the same default value.

    For example in sqsh-2.1.8:

    1> \set | grep maxlen
    maxlen=NULL
    1> \echo $maxlen
    32768

    In sqsh-2.1.9:

    1> \set | grep maxlen
    maxlen=32768

sqsh-2.1.9/src/var_dsp.c
    Feature 2 (datefmt and timefmt implementation)
