                     SQSH 2.4 BINARY RELEASE

Welcome
-=-=-=-=-

Hello and welcome to the binary release of sqsh-2.4.  With this
release quite a bit of effort has gone into supplying handy
pre-built binaries for those of you that are too lazy to type
'configure' and 'make'. :)

What is SQSH?
-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Sqsh (pronounced skwish) is short for SQshelL (pronounced s-q-shell),
it is intended as a replacement for the venerable 'isql' program supplied
by Sybase.  It came about due to years of frustration of trying to do
real work with a program that was never meant to perform real work.

Sqsh is much more than a nice prompt, it is intended to provide much 
of the functionality provided by a good shell, such as variables, 
aliasing, redirection, pipes, back-grounding, job control, history, 
command substitution, and dynamic configuration.  Also, as a 
by-product of the design, it is remarkably easy to extend and add 
functionality.

Availability

Sqsh may be found on the following sites:

    http://www.sqsh.org/
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/sqsh


Licensing
-=-=-=-=-=-

99% of the software that I use is free, therefore I like to give back
in kind. Sqsh is held under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and
therefore may be freely distributed under the terms of this license.

Installing
-=-=-=-=-=-

1. Run the installation shell script and follow the directions.

	% ./install.sh

2. Make sure that you have Open Client installed properly on
   your machine (refer to the FAQ for more information).

3. $SYBASE points to your Open Client installation.

Then you should be off and running.

Additional Files
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Note that there are some additional sample configuration files
that are included in the doc/ directory that are not installed
but are probably worth taking a look at.
The doc/sqshrc-2.4 file may be copied to $HOME/.sqshrc
and make sure you have a .sqsh directory and $HOME/tmp directory.

#!/bin/sh
if [ ! -d $HOME/.sqsh ]; then
  mkdir $HOME/.sqsh && chmod 700 $HOME/.sqsh
fi
if [ ! -d $HOME/tmp]; then
  mkdir $HOME/tmp
fi
cp doc/sqshrc-2.4 $HOME/.sqshrc && chmod 600 $HOME/.sqshrc
